# TODO
- [ ] Get albedo + metalness image working for texturesets
- [ ] Get normal + roughness image working for texturesets
- [ ] Make asset filenames consistent (all from PG_ASSET_DIR, parses only store relative path. Load() makes absolute path, or detects it at least)
- [ ] Make sure image clamping vs wraping working correctly
- [ ] Make model exporter work with texturesets
- [ ] Switch to dynamic rendering
- [ ] simplify TransitionImageLayoutImmediate args with defaults
- [ ] get VS to find spirv/vulkan/shaderc files
- [ ] If assets are already in required/dependent fastfiles, dont put them in the top level FFs
- [ ] change profiling to be all in RAM, no file writing. Show min + max + avg
- [ ] show profiling results in ImGui view
